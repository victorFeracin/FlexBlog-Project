# Flexblog

## About:

HTML & CSS project for the Origamid CSS Flexbox course. With this practice, I learned about the Flex properties and its facilities comparing to a float layout. 

## Link:

**Note**: The link below that takes you to the domain registered by the author and creator of the course (Andr√© Rafael) and shows the whole portfolio page designed and developed for this course. Some things are different in my code, because I changed a little bit (one more margin added and a smaller footer), but other than that, the content is the same.
